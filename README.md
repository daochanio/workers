## Description

This workers project is not entended for core functionality. It should generally only be used for usecases that don't fit within the core backend domain or can be handled with only a small amount of javascript.

### Current usecases:

- Proxy https requests to untrusted servers that we don't want to happen within the execution of the daochan API
